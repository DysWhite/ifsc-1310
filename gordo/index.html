                    <p>Welcome to the page! This is going to just be a completely <em>random</em> assortment of things I think to put here, but I'll do my best to cover everything.</p>

                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>Well, my name is Clayton, but I prefer to go by <strong>Dys</strong>. It's a long story on the nickname, but yeah!</p> 
                    <div id="hobbies-section">
                        <h3>My hobbies</h3>
                        <p>I have lots of various hobbies! They're things like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Making 3D Art</li>
                            <li>Making music</li>
                            <li>Playing games poorly</li>
                            <li>Writing stuff</li>
                            <li>Programming</li>
                            <li>And more</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As you can tell, they're all varied, but they do have something in common. They tend to be on the creative side of things. I like to make things, build things. I find a lot of joy in making stuff that hasn't been a thing before. I use a lot of different software to make this happen.</p>

                    <div id="software-section">
                        <h4>My software and what it's used for</h4>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Blender</dt>
                            <dd>Open source 3D software. It can handle everything from modelling to the final render, and everything in between. It even has a built in ray tracing rendering engine called Cycles.</dd>
                            <dt>FL Studio</dt>
                            <dd>Paid Digital Audio Workstation, or DAW. While FL doesn't come with many synths itself, it makes it easy to make individual parts of a song, and also to string those parts together into one cohesive track.</dd>
                            <dt>Visual Studio</dt>
                            <dd>I'm sure most reading this already know what VS is, but for those that don't, it's an Integrated Developer Environment, or IDE. It makes writing code a lot easier, and provides helpful tools for debugging.</dd>
                        </dl>
                        <p>I use other software and stuff, but it's common things like Word, and stuff like that. So, not super worth talking about.</p>

                        <h4>What games I play</h4>
                        <p>I have a lot of different kinds of games I play. But I do tend to have preferred genres, so I'll list them from my most common to least common below.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>FPS games</li>
                            <li>Sandbox / Open World Survival Craft games</li>
                            <li>Puzzle games</li>
                            <li>Other kinds of games</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>I know the <q>other kinds of games</q> is pretty dang vague, but that's because it covers a lot of different things. 4X strategy, to simulation. </p>
